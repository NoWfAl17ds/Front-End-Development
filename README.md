# Front-End-Development
# Project Summary
Objective:
* Create a user registration form with client-side validation using AngularJS, and integrate it with a backend server to   save user data.

# Components:

* HTML Form:
        Fields: Username, email, password, confirm password.
        Button: Submit form.
* AngularJS:
        Module & Controller: Manages form data and validation.
        Validation: Ensures input correctness (required fields, email format, password rules).
* CSS Styling:
        Provides a clean, centered design with responsive layout and error messaging.
* Backend Integration:
HTTP Request: Sends form data to a server endpoint (/api/register).
Server Response: Handles form submission and provides feedback.
* How It Works:

User Input: User fills out the form.
Validation: AngularJS checks input validity.
Submission: Valid data is sent to the server; feedback is shown based on server response.
